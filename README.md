# Bikesharing

## Overview

To convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. To solidify the proposal, one of the key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis.

- Deliverable 1: Change Trip Duration to a Datetime Format
- Deliverable 2: Create Visualizations for the Trip Analysis
- Deliverable 3: Create a Story and Report for the Final Presentation

## Results

By creating a Tableau Dashboard, the analysis was as shown:

### Checkout Times for Users

### Checkout Times by Gender

### Trips by Weekday per Hour

### Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)

### User Trips by Gender by Weekday

### Number of Rides

### Customer Type

### August Peak Hours

## Summary

The results showed interesting results such as for trips by weekday per hour, the peak hours were at 8am and from 5-6pm. For trips by Gender by weekday per hour, more males were shown taking trips for the morning and evening, and for user trips by gender by weekday, there were more male subscribers.

Two additional visualizations I would perform on the dataset include are mapping out Stations with usage and adding a view that shows where an additional station may be beneficial to be added based on peak usage at other locations and geographic location.
